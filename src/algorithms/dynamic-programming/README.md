# Dynamic Programming

FreeCodeCamp Explanation:

> Dynamic programming amounts to breaking down an optimization problem into simpler sub-problems, and storing the solution to each sub-problem so that each sub-problem is only solved once.

It's all about store data, in a iterative process, so you don't need to recalculate them.

Take a look at `fibonacci.js` example directly from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbwP4w6TpCk&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified).
