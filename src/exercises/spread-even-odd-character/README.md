# Spread even/odd character

Given a string, $ S $, of length $ N $ that is indexed from $ 0 $ to $ N - 1 $, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as $ 2 $ space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

**Note**: $ 0 $ is considered to be an even index.

Example

```javascript
s = adbecf
```

Print `abc def`
