# Tribonacci Sequence

Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata
