# From decimal to binary

Given a base-10 integer, $ n $, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in $ n $'s binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

## Example

$ n=125 $

The binary representation of $ 125_{10} $ is $ 1111101_{2} $. In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.
