# Binary Tree

GeeksforGeeks explanation:

> Binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node of the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL.
