# Queue

GeeksforGeeks explanation:

> A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.

Visualizing how it works:

We can perform a queue using the built-in array of most languages. In JavaScript, the `push` and `shift` methods are used to add and remove an element, for instance.
