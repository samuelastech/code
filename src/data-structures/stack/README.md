# Stack

GeeksforGeeks explanation:

> There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.

Visualizing how it works:

We can perform a stack using the built-in array of most languages. In JavaScript, the `push` and `pop` methods are used to add and remove an element, for instance.
