# Code

This repository gathers algorithms, data structures, and programming exercises. The main goal is to study, learn solutions, and create my own.

## An exercise a day

The goal here is to solve programming exercises every day to create familiarity with a programming language.
You can create a directory inside the `exercises` folder with the title of the problem you are solving. There, you can create a `README.md` with a description of the problem and a `solutions.ext`.
