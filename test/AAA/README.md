# AAA

AAA stands for Arrange, Act, Assert. It's a pattern for testing front-end components. Here is what each one of these means:
- Arrange: you organize the components by rendering them for example using `render` from `@testing-library/react`;
- Act: you dispatch events on the components;
- Assert: you verify if the components behave as you wish given an event.
